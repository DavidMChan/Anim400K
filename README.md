# What is Anim400K?

Anim400K is a large-scale dataset of aligned audio-video clips in both the English and Japanese languages. It is comprised of over 425K aligned clips (763 hours) consisting of both video and audio drawn from over 190 properties covering hundreds of themes and genres. Anim400K is further augmented with metadata including genres, themes, show-ratings, character profiles, and animation styles at a property level, episode synopses, ratings, and subtitles at an episode level, and pre-computed ASR at an aligned clip level to enable in-depth research into several audio-visual tasks.
